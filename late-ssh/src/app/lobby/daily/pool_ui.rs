//! Full-screen daily pool board: the table on the left, the info panel and the
//! cue panel stacked on the right, key hints on the floor.
//!
//! ## Why the split
//!
//! A 2.25 inch ball on a 7 foot table is a thirty-fifth of its length, so at
//! any terminal width the table view is an *overview* — you can read the
//! layout off it, but you cannot aim on it. The cue panel is the other half of
//! that trade: it shows the target ball and the cue ball large, from the
//! shooter's eye, and a fraction of a degree of aim moves the sighting mark
//! there while moving nothing at all on the table.
//!
//! Both are drawn by `pool_core` (`table_ui` and `cue_ui`) into a half-block
//! `Canvas`, so this file is layout, chrome and wording only. Nothing here
//! knows any physics.
//!
//! ## Guiding the player
//!
//! Nothing about a shot is sequenced: target, spin, aim and stroke are all
//! live at once and the player may strike at any moment. What changes is which
//! of them the *pointer* is steering, and the hint row is rewritten from
//! `ShotMode::hint` to say so, on the status line beside the mode's name.
//! That string lives in `pool_core` beside the mode enum rather than here, so
//! the controls and the description of them cannot drift apart.
//!
//! The keys live in a legend under the cue panel, in the right column, and
//! nowhere else: a hint row along the bottom used to repeat half of them,
//! and a row spent saying the same thing twice is a row the cue drawing does
//! not get. A game with this many controls should not make a player memorise
//! them, so the cue drawing is capped and the legend takes the rows below.
