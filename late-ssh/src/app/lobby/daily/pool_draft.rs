//! The shot being composed, and everything else pool keeps per-session.
//!
//! This file is the pool game's half of the split that `state.rs` documents:
//! the shared daily state owns the *seam* — the roster arms, the reload
//! machinery, the service handle — and everything that is purely pool lives
//! here. The rule of thumb that fell out of building it: if a function takes
//! `(&mut PoolDraft, &DailyPoolState)` and touches no `DailyState` field, it
//! belongs in this file, and the first version of pool that ignored that rule
//! put a thousand lines of game into the shared state.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to the service or the database. A draft becomes a
//! `Shot` (`PoolDraft::shot`) and the seam sends it.
//!
//! The last section of the file is the other half of that rule. Pool is the
//! only daily game that animates, so it is the only one that needs a physics
//! worker, a playback queue and a reason to sit on news — and all of that
//! reads and writes `DailyBoardState`, which is shared. It lives here anyway,
//! because **every field it touches is a pool field**: the rule is about who
//! owns the code, not which struct the bytes sit in, and `state.rs` keeps arms
//! only. That is why this file imports from `state.rs` while `state.rs`
//! imports from it; the cycle is fine and the alternative is a thousand lines
//! of pool in the shared file, which is what the rule exists to prevent.
