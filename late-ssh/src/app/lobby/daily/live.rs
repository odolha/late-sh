//! The live board: what one active match looks like from across the room.
//!
//! A compact, per-game snapshot of a match's position, built once per
//! snapshot publish from the same state JSON the service already parses for
//! move counts, and carried on every `DailyMatchItem`. The live strip
//! (`app/live/`) paints one at the top of the Home chat, the viewer's own
//! included, while something just happened to it, and a match that just
//! ended for a minute after (`finish_headline`); `live_strip.rs` is what a
//! match looks like there. It holds positions only, never a hidden
//! hand or a fleet: a live board is a spectator's view even for the players,
//! so it keeps exactly the secrets the spectate board keeps (`battleship_ui`
//! shows public shots only, `briscola_ui` shows backs).
