//! Pool's input: the key map and the mouse, for all three cue games.
//!
//! One file per surface concern, mirroring `pool_ui.rs`: `board_input`
//! dispatches here with a single call per event kind and knows nothing else
//! about pool. The gate (`is_pool_board`) lives beside the handlers it gates,
//! asked of `DailyMatchDetail::pool()` — the one list of pool detail variants
//! — because a hand-copied variant list in front of an input layer is how
//! snooker shipped with a board where nothing responded.
//!
//! Everything here works through `App` and the pub surface of the daily
//! state. The two things pool input needs that are not pub — the service
//! handle for sending a shot, and the aim-share throttle — stay behind
//! `DailyState` methods (`pool_send`, `pool_publish_aim`).
