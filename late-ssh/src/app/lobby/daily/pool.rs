//! Pool state for daily correspondence matches: eight-ball and nine-ball.
//!
//! One state type serves both games. They share a table, a rack format, a
//! physics kernel and a shot; what differs is the ruleset, and that is a field
//! (`PoolRules`) rather than a second struct. This is the one place the daily
//! domain's "a variant is one game with different setup" rule bends: the
//! roster carries two entries because 8-ball and 9-ball genuinely are two
//! games, but everything below the ruleset is shared.
//!
//! ## What is stored, and what is recomputed
//!
//! A single shot can generate thousands of integration steps. Storing that per
//! move would put megabytes into a JSONB column, so the state keeps only what
//! cannot be recomputed:
//!
//! - `rack` — where the balls are now. Authoritative, so opening a board never
//!   re-simulates the match to find out.
//! - `prev_rack` — where they were before the last shot. Exactly enough to
//!   re-simulate that one shot and animate it, which is the only shot anyone
//!   ever watches.
//! - `shots` — the inputs, for the move list and for a full replay.
//!
//! Re-simulation is safe because `pool_core` is deterministic and runs only on
//! the server; there is no client that could disagree about the result. The
//! table preset is stored by name and resolved through `table::preset` so a
//! retuned coefficient can never silently reinterpret a stored rack.
