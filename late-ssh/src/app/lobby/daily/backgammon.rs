//! Backgammon rules for daily correspondence matches. Pure state + logic, no
//! I/O: the service persists `DailyBackgammonState` as the match's `state`
//! JSON the same way the other daily games persist theirs.
//!
//! Backgammon is the first roster game where "state = move history" is not
//! enough: the dice are server-rolled, so every turn is stored as its roll
//! plus the hops played with it, and `next_roll` carries the roll the current
//! mover has not played yet. The board, pip counts, and whose turn it is are
//! still derived by replaying the history; the turn is plain parity (white
//! moves first) because forced passes are recorded as turns with no hops.
//! There is no doubling cube in v1 (the payout is a fixed reward template).
//!
//! Rules enforced here: bar checkers must re-enter first, a maximal number of
//! dice must be played (and the higher die when only one can be), landing on
//! a lone opposing checker sends it to the bar, and bearing off requires the
//! whole side home (a die larger than the farthest checker bears off from the
//! farthest point). First to bear off all fifteen wins. Backgammon cannot
//! really draw, but a defensive stall cap turns an endless mutual blockage
//! into one instead of wedging the match forever.
