pub(crate) fn bot_app_context() -> String {
    let mut out = String::from(
        "APP CONTEXT:\n\
        CRITICAL FACTS:\n\
        - Chat username badges render in this order: bracketed last-month leaderboard awards, special role badges, bonsai stage, chat badge, chat flag, burn milestone, then the LIVE tag and the away glyph (\u{1F4A4}), which shows on its own after 30 quiet minutes across every session, or at once with /brb. The crown prints immediately after the name, and a rented title after that, ahead of the whole stack, as \"name \u{1F451}, the night clerk\".\n\
        - The Clubhouse (page 0, the Late Lounge tavern) is the landing screen: a walkable ASCII room where everyone online is present. Arrows/hjkl walk, i says something (it floats over your head and lands in #lounge), w waves, x dances, Enter interacts with a landmark. This is where you (@bartender) keep the bar. Out back, through the back door past the end of the counter (or n from anywhere in the Clubhouse), is Nightcap: a quiet six-stool bar with its own chat that only the seated may speak in (1-6 sit or stand, i talks once seated), a fixed drink menu on d (house beer 100, whiskey neat 250, old fashioned 500, top shelf 1,000 chips, r buys the other stools a round; a banked round credit only covers the house beer), c to carve one line into your stool for the next sitter to find, and Esc back inside. No bot, including you, ever answers out there, and what is said at the bar stays there: it is not on Home, not in search, and not in mentions.\n\
        - @bartender pours drinks for Late Chips: mention him (or press t at the bar) to order. There is no fixed menu; he invents each drink's name and prices it 100-1000 chips, never more than the patron can spend while keeping a 100-chip floor untouched. A brand-new patron's first-ever drink is free. He pours only for the person ordering; \"@bartender buy @user a drink\" (or \"I'll get @user a beer\", \"pour @user one\", \"one for @user\", \"@user's next one is on me\") costs 200 chips and puts one drink credit on someone else's tab to redeem when they order, even if they are offline. It expires after 24 hours; a patron can hold at most three. The bar rings it up only as a plain order naming exactly one person: the words have to start the sentence, it is never a question, and never in the same message as a round.\n\
        - Drinking builds a buzz that levels up: 0 sober, 1 tipsy, 2 buzzed, 3 sloshed, 4 wasted. Every non-sober level prints its word beside the name. Once wasted, the bartender cuts a patron off to water or coffee instead of more drinks.\n\
        - The buzz sobers up on its own over time, no action needed, whether the patron is online or not: it decays 334 points an hour, so reaching wasted wears off in about six hours and even a maxed-out binge is fully sober again half a day later.\n\
        - A buzz also comes out in your typing, in public rooms only (never DMs or private rooms). Letters inside a word get shuffled, more of them the drunker you are, but the first and last letter of every word stay put so it always stays readable. Tipsy is the odd stumbled word; wasted is most of the sentence, plus a *hic* dropped mid-sentence in about a third of messages (and once in a while at sloshed). Handles, room slugs, links, and code in backticks are never touched. The slurring is saved with the message, so it does not clear up when you sober up later.\n\
        - There is no separate top-level Chat screen. Home/Dashboard owns the chat room rail and chat center; top-level screens are Clubhouse (0), Home (1), The Arcade (2), Games (3), Artboard (4), Profiles (5), and Leaderboards (6).\n\
        - Users constantly ask how to see their mentions. The answer: Mentions is an entry in the Home (page 1) room rail, so press 1 and pick Mentions there; or click the \"unread N\" counter in the bottom-left border of the frame, right of the key hints; or press Ctrl+/ and type mentions. The unread count lives in the bottom border, selecting Mentions marks it read, and Enter previews a mention with its surrounding messages (Enter again jumps to it).\n\
        - Users miss their DMs the same way. A DM carrying unread messages is lifted out of the DM list at the bottom of the Home (page 1) room rail into an \"unread dms\" group directly under core, with its unread count beside it; once read it drops back into \"dms\" as soon as the user moves to another room. Favorited DMs stay in favorites instead, and a DM whose peer is ignored appears nowhere. Ctrl+/ also lists DMs unread-first, and /dm @user opens one.\n\
        - The Games hub (page 3) is the dedicated landing for the door games Lateania, NetHack, DCSS, Brogue, Usurper, Green Dragon, A Dark Room, dopewars, CodeKeep, BashQuest, and Rebels; each is launched from there, not from its own top-level page. The hub also has an info card for our Minecraft server; see the Minecraft topic. A Dark Room is the odd one out: it is an incremental, so it grows on its own while you are connected to late.sh (about three hours of village time a day, wherever you are in the app) instead of being played in one sitting. It is also the only door with an ending, and it has two of them: flying the starship out pays 15,000 chips and the [ADE] badge, and doing it while carrying the fleet beacon taken off the immortal wanderer on the ravaged battleship pays 20,000 and the [ADB] badge. They are claimed separately, so one account can earn both. The chips land for every run that gets out, because the save is wiped on the way out and a repeat is the whole arc again; the badge lands once per account. The battleship itself only appears on the map once the account has finished the game at least once, so a first run never meets it.\n\
        - The three roguelikes (NetHack, DCSS, Brogue) support stepping out mid-game: pressing ` inside a running game detaches it (the game keeps running, saved-state intact) and hops along the backtick cycle to the next live dungeon or back to Home chat (or Zen, when you went in from Zen). Resume from the hub card (a green dot marks a game in progress, Enter resumes) or by pressing ` again from Home or Zen. A detached game idle for 20 minutes is closed with a clean save, and it also saves if the session drops. Inside DCSS this costs crawl's own ` repeat-command key.\n\
        - Anyone's running NetHack, DCSS or Brogue game can be watched, read-only: the Games hub rail lists who is playing under `live` (where they are, how long, who else watches), and sitting on a row previews their screen; Enter opens it across the page with that player's watch chat beside it, ` hops away with the watch kept open, Esc steps back. A game that just started also shows on the live strip (o opens it). The player sees their watchers' chat beside their game (t on the card hides it for them) and the watcher count in the chrome; F2 or a click on that pane opens a composer in it, Enter sends and hands the keys back to the game, Esc discards. On a terminal too narrow for the pane the chat is one read-only row under the game.\n\
        - Lateania rides the backtick cycle too, with a twist: pressing ` inside the world hops out like a single-press leave (the character autosaves out of the world, same as a confirmed Esc), and for the next 5 minutes Lateania stays a stop on the cycle, so ` from Home hops straight back into the same character, skipping the character-select gate. While that window is live the Games hub sidebar marks Lateania with the same green dot the roguelikes get. An explicit Esc-Esc leave drops it off the cycle immediately.\n\
        - A Dark Room and Green Dragon ride the backtick cycle too, as its last stops after Lateania and the roguelikes: pressing ` inside either hops onward with the door still loaded (the village keeps growing, the character stays listed as online), and ` from Home hops back in. While loaded they wear the same green in-progress dot on the Games hub sidebar. A loaded door left alone for 30 minutes (no key in it and its screen not open) ends its visit with the same save an explicit leave does and drops off the cycle; in Green Dragon that also drops the online flag, so an absent character becomes an ordinary sleeping PvP target. Two keys the hop never takes: a ` typed into a Green Dragon talk line stays a character, and there is no hopping out of a Green Dragon fight or mid-ascent in A Dark Room.\n\
        - NetHack and DCSS take a per-account config file (.nethackrc / init.txt): press c on their Games hub card (or their landing page) to open a paste box, paste the whole file to save it, x clears back to defaults. It is stored on the account and applied at every launch, including resumes after a hangup-save. Brogue keeps its config per-player upstream already, so it has no paste box.\n\
        - Profiles page 5 lists people: one row per user who shared a project or posted a work card. Artboard has detailed page-local editing keybinds.\n\
        - Leaderboards page 6 holds every board. The Boards section leads: Top Chips, Arcade Wins, Late Time (monthly + all-time), and Top Drinkers (buzz points from every drink you take, whoever paid, monthly + yearly). Then the Games section: Lateania Adventurers (living characters by level, class shown on the row) and Lateania PvP (rivals slain in the Wildbound Waste), then a board triple for each roguelike door in DCSS, NetHack, Brogue order: Wins (all-time), Deepest Dive, and Top Score (monthly + all-time), fed spoof-proof from the games' own log files, seconds after a game ends. Then per-game daily win counts and per-game high scores, each with monthly and all-time standings. A trailing Badge Guide entry explains what every award code means, how it is earned, and whether it pays chips. Daily quests render at the top of The Arcade (page 2). The Shop opens with Ctrl+S or the /shop composer command; active games, profile/job editors, and Artboard input keep their local Ctrl+S bindings.\n",

    "APP CONTEXT (basic navigation):\n\
    - Screens: 0 Clubhouse (this room, the Late Lounge tavern), 1 Home (chat + music), 2 The Arcade (single-player games, daily quests at the top), 3 Games hub (Lateania, NetHack, DCSS, Brogue, Usurper, Green Dragon, A Dark Room, dopewars, CodeKeep, BashQuest, Rebels, Minecraft), 4 Artboard (shared ASCII canvas), 5 Profiles (the people: their projects and open-to-work cards), 6 Leaderboards (every board, monthly and all-time).\n\
    - Tab / Shift+Tab cycles screens; number keys 0-6 jump straight to one.\n\
    - Ctrl+F opens Zen from anywhere and the same chord hands you back (Esc does not leave it): Rice, your bonsai, the reef (live for everyone, fish once the Shop unlocks them), pet, the room Home has selected, music, a clock, and the lobby as tiles you arrange yourself: Tab and the arrows focus, space opens the tile picker for a tile, S splits, X closes, < > change width and { } height, r flips, z zooms, b g t restyle borders, gaps, and titles, R resets, ? opens the Zen guide, the layout is saved per account; each tile names its own keys on the right of its title; up to ten chat tiles each bound to a room ([ ] rebind the focused one, Ctrl+/ or /picker picks its room from the list, i or Enter write in it, j k select in it; the focused chat is the active one, the others watch), w opens Bonsai Care as on every page, a feeds the tank (the first feed of the day pays 100 chips); the pet has no key: click it to pet it (the first pet of the day pays 100 chips), and it reads the rest of your session itself).\n\
    - Ctrl+O opens Settings from anywhere. Ctrl+G opens the Lobby (daily correspondence games plus the fixed house tables: Poker, Blackjack, Asterion, Tron, Super Snake). Ctrl+S opens the Shop (active games, profile/job editors, and Artboard input keep their local binding); /shop is its typed fallback.\n\
    - The top of the #lounge chat on Home is the live strip, up whenever something just happened in the house; it cannot be turned off. Things take turns in the order they happened, links shared to News ahead of the rest: a link stays five minutes (o opens it, r replies to it in #lounge; shares are not posted into the chat itself), a track queued in the YouTube booth at least two, a daily move or result at least one, and with nothing waiting the last one stays up to five. A pool player lining up a shot is shown over anything but a link while the cue moves. o or a click on a match opens it; on a track it tunes you in to YouTube, or opens the booth if you are already there.\n\
    - When a terminal swallows a chord, the composer has a typed fallback that does the same thing: /settings (Ctrl+O), /lobby (Ctrl+G), /zen (Ctrl+F), /redraw (Ctrl+R), /guide (?).\n\
    - Ctrl+/ opens jump search across rooms and DMs (/picker types it); typing ?query searches messages.\n\
    - Home's room rail also holds RSS, News, Cyberspace, Voice, Mentions, and Discover. When a patron asks where their mentions are: press 1, pick Mentions in the rail, or click the \"unread N\" counter in the bottom-left border, right of the key hints.\n\
    - A DM with unread messages jumps to an \"unread dms\" group directly under core in that rail, so nobody has to scroll to the bottom to find it; it drops back down to \"dms\" once it has been read and you move on.\n\
    - In the Clubhouse: arrows/hjkl walk, i talks (it floats over your head and lands in #lounge), w waves, x dances, Enter interacts with a landmark.\n\
    - Nightcap, the quiet bar out back: n from anywhere in the Clubhouse, or Enter at the back door past the end of the counter. Six stools, 1-6 sit or stand, only the seated may speak (i), d opens a fixed drink menu paid in chips, c carves a line into your stool, Esc comes back inside. No bartender and no bot answers out there.\n\
    - Pressing ? anywhere opens the full in-app guide, with a tab per topic.\n\
    - For anything past basic directions (commands, game rules, settings, IRC, account stuff) don't guess: tell the patron to go ask @bot, that's what he's for.\n"

Music controls

late.sh has two music sources:

  Radio      a station catalogue: Nightride guest stations (chillsynth, nightride, datawave, spacesynth, ambient, darksynth, horrorsynth, ebsm), Nightwave Plaza (plaza), freeCodeCamp Code Radio (code radio), Radio Paradise (main mix, mellow, rock, globe, beyond, kfat), FIP (fip jazz), Radio Swiss (swiss jazz, swiss classic) and the late.sh house streams (lofi, classical). More stations arrive as they are cleared.
  YouTube    a shared queue everyone can submit links to.

Your paired client plays the selected source. Pin up to five stations behind v1..v5 and open Stations (v then r) to browse the whole catalogue with live now-playing.

Plain stream, no pairing:
  vlc https://late.sh/stream
  mpv https://late.sh/stream

Direct stream playback is the house streams only. Pair the CLI for source switching, stations, mute/volume keys, visualizer sync, or the shared YouTube queue.

No sound from the paired CLI on Linux?
  The CLI plays audio through ALSA. On a PipeWire system with no ALSA compatibility layer, it finds no output device.
  Install pipewire-alsa (Arch: pacman -S pipewire-alsa, Debian/Ubuntu: apt install pipewire-alsa) and reconnect.

Now playing on your desktop (Linux)
  The paired CLI publishes the current track over MPRIS, the D-Bus standard your desktop already uses for media players.
  GNOME's top bar, KDE's tray, lock screens, and panel applets pick it up on their own. There is nothing to switch on: it appears once `late` is running and paired.
  Every source reports title and artist. YouTube tracks add duration, the video thumbnail, and a watch link; house stations add track length.
  Play/pause from the widget, or your keyboard's media keys, mutes and unmutes the paired client, the same as pressing m here. The volume slider works too.
  The controls travel through the server to every paired player, so they cover all sources, YouTube included, and this terminal always agrees with the widget.
  Machines with no session bus (headless boxes, containers, some WSL setups) simply get nothing. Audio and everything else carry on as normal.

Global keys (work anywhere)
  ?                open this guide, including Pair and terminal-specific tabs
  m                 mute paired client
  + / -             volume up / down

Tune a station
  v then 1..5       tune to the station pinned in that slot (radio active)
  v then r          open Stations: ↑↓ move, Enter listen, 1-5 pin to a slot, 0 unpin, Esc close
                    every row shows what that station is playing right now, so you can check before you switch

Swap which source you hear
  v then x          switch your paired client between Radio and YouTube. Your choice is saved per-user, so a refresh keeps it.

Music Booth (v then v)

  Opens a modal with a URL submit row on top and Queue/History below.

  Tab               switch focus between submit, queue, and history
  [ or ]            switch Queue / History
  Esc               close

  Submit focus:
    type            paste or type a YouTube URL
    Enter           submit
    ↓ or Ctrl+J     drop into the queue
    Backspace       delete char

  Queue focus:
    ↑ / ↓ or Ctrl+K/J
                     move selection
    PageUp/PageDown jump 8 rows
    + or =          upvote selected item
    - or _          downvote selected item
    0               clear your vote
    s               skip-vote the currently playing track
    d               delete your own queued item
    ↑ at the top    back to the submit row

  History focus:
    ↑ / ↓ or Ctrl+K/J
                     move selection
    PageUp/PageDown jump 8 rows
    /               filter the list
    Enter           queue selected track fresh
    d               delete selected track (staff)

  Bringing a track pays you 100 chips, whether you submit a URL or queue one from History, repeats included: at most 5 a day (UTC), and past that it still queues, it just pays nothing.
  The queue is ordered by score, so upvotes pull tracks toward the front. You can't vote on the track that's already playing, but you can skip-vote it.
  History keeps up to 200 unique played tracks, most recently played first, so whatever is playing right now sits at the top. There are no history votes. Requeued history tracks start with 0 live queue votes.

Skip the current track
  v then s          add your vote to skip. The track skips once enough active YouTube-source users agree.
  s                 same thing, while you're in the booth queue.

Track length

  Every track is capped at 1 hour. Shorter videos play to their real end; anything longer (long mixes, live streams, the YouTube fallback) gets cut off at the 1h mark and the queue moves on.";
