                with their own. Rage is their fuel: it does not pool while they rest but \
                kindles in the fight itself, every wound taken and given stoking it higher \

                forgets nothing it touches. Mana is their well, deep but not bottomless, and \

                and refuse to let a companion fall. Holy fire answers the wicked and \
                searing light judges the undead, while a whispered prayer knits torn flesh \

                distance no blade can answer, layering venom and volley and the cold \
                wisdom of a hundred camps. Focus is their discipline, spent on shots that \

                things, calling thorns from bare stone and rain from a clear sky, then \
                mending what the fight has torn as easily as breathing. Spirit is their \
                tether to the living world; while it holds, so do they. A Druid does not \

                fuel; where others mourn, they harvest. Shadow answers their call, draining \
                the warmth from the living to feed their own cold endurance, and every foe \
                that falls before them yields up its Souls to be spent again. They are not \

                telling. Their power is Tempo, kept by ear and spent in verses that mend an \
                ally, hearten a line, or unstring a foe's nerve at the worst possible moment. \

                before the enemy hears it begin. Ki flows where attention goes, spent on \

                fail to land. They own nothing and need less, and that is exactly what makes \

                the line it holds and brings holy fire down on whatever broke against it. \
                Their Mana is faith made usable, poured out in shields and smitings without \

                bargains, and a hunger that the gathered dead keep fed. Mana is the form their \
                pact takes, replenished by the dying, spent without restraint. A Warlock is \
                not reckless so much as certain: they have already paid the worst price, and \

                they come to the end, until a creature half-dead is twice as dangerous as it \
