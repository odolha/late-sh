// Combat companions for Lateania.

// A pet is a creature an adventurer buys from a capital Stable. It travels with
// its owner (it lives on `PlayerState`, so it is always in the same room),
// fights the owner's target each combat round, can be downed when its owner is
// struck, and grows stronger as it is fed (loyalty). Only the species table and
// the growth maths live here; the world wiring (buying, feeding, combat) is in
// `svc.rs`.

/// A buyable companion species: the fixed template a live `Pet` grows from.
