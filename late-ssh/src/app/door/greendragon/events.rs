//! Forest special events: the non-combat vignettes LoGD fires before a fight on
//! roughly 15% of searches (`forestchance`). This is the stock-core set of eight
//! forest-hooked event modules from `jimlunsford/lotgd` — findgold, findgem,
//! goldmine, fairy, glowingstream, crazyaudrey, foilwench, darkhorse.
//!
//! **Licensing.** The effect mechanics (gold/gem ranges, roll tables, heal/turn
//! deltas) are transcribed 1=1 from those modules — pure numbers, uncopyrightable
//! — exactly like the creature stat blocks in [`super::data`]. All prose here is
//! **original to late.sh**; no module text is copied. One adaptation:
//! `glowingstream` rolls 1..=10 and cases 8..=10 fall through to a plain full
//! heal (the module's `default:`), kept as-is. `darkhorse` opens the real
//! tavern room (the gambler's three games, `state`'s `Mode::Tavern`); its
//! PvP enemy-intel and comment board wait for the multiplayer phase.
