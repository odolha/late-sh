//! Legend of the Green Dragon service: thin persistence + reward plumbing for
//! the single-player door. Unlike Lateania there is no shared world, no tick
//! loop, and no watch-published world snapshot — each session owns the
//! authoritative character in its own `state::State`. This service only loads
//! the character once (off the DB) and saves blobs back, fire-and-forget.
//!
//! Cheap to `Clone`: everything lives behind an `Arc`.
