//! Balance data for the Green Dragon door.
//!
//! Two different things live here, with two different provenances:
//!
//! 1. **Numeric balance tables** — the cost/power ladders, per-level creature
//!    stat blocks, the experience curve, master/dragon stats. These are
//!    transcribed from the established LoGD balance (the DragonPrime-lineage
//!    seed `jimlunsford/lotgd@master`). Game mechanics and the numbers that
//!    express them are not copyrightable, so transcribing them keeps the game
//!    feeling authentic instead of re-tuned, with no licensing entanglement.
//!
//! 2. **Flavor text** — creature names, master names, and gear names. These are
//!    *original to late.sh*, written fresh. We deliberately do **not** reuse the
//!    seed's names: that seed is CC BY-NC-SA, whose NonCommercial + ShareAlike
//!    terms conflict with shipping inside late.sh. Names are the copyrightable
//!    layer, so ours are our own and carry no obligation.
//!
//! Numeric source files (all `jimlunsford/lotgd@master`):
//! - cost ladder / creature / master stat seeds: `lib/installer/installer_sqlstatements.php`
//! - experience curve + dragonkill scaling: `lib/experience.php`
//! - combat formula: `lib/battle-skills.php` (`rolldamage`)
//! - dragon stats / gating: `dragon.php`, `lib/forest.php`
