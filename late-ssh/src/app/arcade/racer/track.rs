//! Track data model for the Racer game.
//!
//! A **track** is a named, multi-stage course. Each [`Stage`] defines the road
//! geometry, traffic, scenery, and theme that apply while the player is in that
//! stage. Stages succeed each other when the player covers their `distance`
//! budget; the next stage can have completely different lane counts, themes,
//! sceneries, and dividers.
//!
//! Tracks are hard-coded as `&'static` Rust data (no file I/O), so authoring a
//! new one is a code change. See `tracks/sample.rs` for an end-to-end example
//! and `tracks/presets.rs` for reusable building blocks.
//!
//! # Extensibility
//!
//! Aspects (lane surfaces, dividers, scenery, shoulders, obstacles, objects) are
//! **open** — each is a small struct holding fn-pointer(s) for rendering.  The
//! standard library lives in `theme.rs` as `pub const` instances (e.g.
//! `theme::LANE_ASPHALT_PREMIUM`).  A new track can define its own instances
//! inline; no changes to `track.rs` or `theme.rs` are needed.
//!
//! [`Theme`] remains a closed enum for now.  Extending it means adding a variant
//! here and a `tint` branch in `theme.rs`.
//!
//! # Coordinate units
//!
//! All distance/speed values are in **displayed** units (the numbers the player
//! sees).  [`Track::distance_scale`] and [`Track::speed_scale`] convert between
//! these and the internal physics units used by `racer::state`.
