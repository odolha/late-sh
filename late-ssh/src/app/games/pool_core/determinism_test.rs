//! The replay contract.
//!
//! This is the only place in the kernel that asserts on raw bit patterns, and
//! it is deliberate. Everything the game does with a shot — showing the
//! opponent what happened, letting a spectator watch, reloading a board after
//! a restart — rests on re-simulating from the stored inputs and getting the
//! same answer. "Close enough" is not a contract; `f64::to_bits` is.
//!
//! Note what `round_trip_survives_the_database` does with rounding. Coordinates
//! are rounded on the way into Postgres, so the *reference* run has to be
//! rounded too. Skipping that turns the test into "does rounding change
//! anything", which it obviously does, instead of "does a rack that has been
//! through the database replay the same way", which is the thing that matters.
