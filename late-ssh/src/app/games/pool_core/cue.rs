//! The cue strike: what the player's aim, tip placement and stroke speed do
//! to the cue ball.
//!
//! The cue is always level — no elevation, so no masse and no jump shots.
//! That keeps every ball on the cloth, which the rest of the kernel assumes.
//!
//! ## The algebra
//!
//! With shot direction `d̂`, left-hand tangent `t̂ = ẑ × d̂`, and a tip offset
//! `(a, b)` in ball radii (`a` across the face, `b` up it), the tip meets the
//! back of the ball at
//!
//! ```text
//! c = R(−w·d̂ + a·t̂ + b·ẑ),   w = √(1 − a² − b²)
//! ```
//!
//! A level cue's impulse is horizontal, `J = m·V·d̂`, so `v = V·d̂` and
//! `ω = (c × J)/I` works out to
//!
//! ```text
//! ω = (5V / 2R)·(−b·d̂y, b·d̂x, −a)
//! ```
//!
//! Two checks fall out of that, and they are the cheapest way to know the
//! signs are right:
//!
//! - **Natural roll at `b = 0.4`.** Rolling needs `ωx = −vy/R`, i.e.
//!   `5b/2R = 1/R`, i.e. `b = 2/5`. Strike two fifths of a radius above
//!   centre and the ball rolls from the moment it leaves the tip.
//! - **Tip left gives clockwise english.** `a > 0` puts the tip left of
//!   centre and yields `ωz < 0`, which is clockwise seen from above.
//!
//! Anything past half a radius from centre miscues in real life, so
//! `Strike::new` refuses it rather than modelling a bad hit.
