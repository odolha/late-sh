//! The shot line: where the cue ball goes along an aim, and what it meets.
//!
//! An aim is a bearing from the cue ball. Everything else a player wants to
//! know about it is *derived* by walking that bearing across the table: the
//! first ball it reaches and where the cue ball will be when it touches it
//! (the ghost ball), the first stretch of the line the object ball leaves on,
//! the stun line the cue ball leaves on, or the cushion the cue ball meets
//! first and where it comes off it. None of this is physics: it is the
//! straight-line geometry every player draws in their head before a shot,
//! and it is cheap enough to redo on every pointer event.
//!
//! The one piece of physics the line does borrow is **throw**: a cut drags
//! the object ball a few degrees off the line of centres, toward the side the
//! cue ball is travelling to, and over a table's length that is more than a
//! pocket forgives. The object ball's leg leaves along `collide::throw`, the
//! same impulse model the simulator resolves the contact with, so the drawn
//! leg is where the ball goes and not where a diagram says it should.
//!
//! The object ball's leg is drawn short on purpose (`OBJECT_GUIDE_REACH`):
//! it shows which way the ball leaves, not where it ends up. Carried to the
//! first thing it met, it said whether a shot pots before the shot was
//! played, which is the part of the game the player is meant to judge.
//!
//! Surface-agnostic like the rest of the kernel: the board screen and a
//! future live table draw the same line.
//!
//! **The cue ball off a cushion is the exception to "none of this is
//! physics"**, because the straight-line geometry there is wrong in a way a
//! player can see. Off the rail the ball's spin no longer matches its new
//! direction, so it slides, and the cloth bends its path until it rolls again
//! — with centre ball, never mind english. A drawn mirror (even one turned for
//! side, which is all it used to be) is the direction the ball leaves on, not
//! the way it goes. So when the caller can say how the shot will be struck,
//! the rebound is the simulator's own path for the cue ball alone on the table
//! (`trace_rebound`), drawn as the curve it is.
