//! The split matters for persistence. A shot can generate thousands of
//! integration steps and hundreds of contacts; storing that per move would put
//! megabytes into a Postgres JSON column. So **only `Shot` and the resulting
//! `RackState` are persisted**, and the `Timeline` is re-derived by
//! re-simulating whenever someone needs to watch it. That is safe because the
//! simulation is deterministic and runs entirely server-side — there is no
