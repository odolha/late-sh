//! The shooter's-eye view of the whole table: the same rack, seen from behind
//! the cue ball along the line of the shot.
//!
//! ## Why this is a raycaster and not a 3D renderer
//!
//! Everything worth seeing on a pool table lies on one plane. So instead of
//! projecting geometry onto the screen — which needs near-plane clipping, a
//! polygon rasteriser, and a horizon that has to be handled as a special case
//! — this walks the *screen* and asks each pixel what it is looking at: cast a
//! ray, intersect the cloth, and look up what is at that spot on the table.
//! Rays that pass above the horizon never hit the plane and are the room, for
//! free. The whole projection is four lines of arithmetic and there is no
//! clipping anywhere.
//!
//! It also buys the reverse mapping, which is what the mouse needs: a click is
//! a pixel, a pixel is a ray, a ray is a point on the cloth. The overview's
//! `View::to_table` has an exact twin here rather than an approximation.
//!
//! Only the balls are drawn as projected objects, because they are the only
//! things standing *off* the cloth. They are painted far to near, so a ball in
//! front covers one behind it — which is the whole point of the view, since a
//! ball hidden behind another is a shot you cannot take.
